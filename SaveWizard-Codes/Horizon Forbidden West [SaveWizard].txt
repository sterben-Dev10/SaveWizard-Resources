if cheat does not apply, since the medals slot in the save has more then one spot
    
Max Hunting Medals - Outdated (Hit Or Miss)

88010004 0A070081
93000000 00000006

Author Notes:
works out that there another item that as same type id as hunter medal i found in some saves it seems to always be one and the first search result
i don't want to edit it by accident if it needs to stay as one
so made this code which will skip if it finds it and search for next result

Max Hunting Medals [ALT] (Need More then 1 Medal) - Outdated (Hit Or Miss)
80010004 59050200
88010004 0A070081
93000000 00000006
D8000000 01020100
08000000 00000063
88020004 0A070081
93000000 00000006
08000000 00000063
Author Notes:
also max with these codes is 63 (99) because anything higher and we need to add a extra byte in front of value. 
if you do have more than 100 medals in game the extra byte should already be added there shouldnt be problem going higher than 63 
but there might be a in game cap on each

XP Code [Must Use SW XP Cheat 1st Then Run This Code]
80010004 FFE0F505
28000000 VVVVVVVV
Notes: V = Value (XP Value)
Math Formula: ((((Desired LvL X Desired Level) -1 LvL)/2)X1000) Then Convert to Hex
Example: level 59 XP: 58 X 59 = 3422,
3422 / 2 = 1711, 
1711 X 1000 = 1711000 XP, Then Convert To Hex: 1711000 = 1A1B98 In Hex
Code Becomes:
80010004 FFE0F505
28000000 001A1B98 <-- V [001A1B98] 1711000 XP

## Additional AM Notes ##
[Pj1980#8357] XP Calculation:
To work out the level you want multiple that level by the next level then divide by 2
then multiply by 1000 then reverse it to little endian. 
Example level 30 is 30 X 31 = 930, 930/2=465, 465X1000 = 465000.
SW Default Max XP: FFE0F50F (267772159)
