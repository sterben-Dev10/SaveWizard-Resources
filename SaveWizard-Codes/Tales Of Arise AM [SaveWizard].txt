Tales Of Arise Advanced Mode Guide By Lotus#0676

Accessory Modification (ADVANCE MODE ONLY)

The item inventory starts at  B2C77888 (search this value first in AM, or just search B2C7), this IS NOT where accessory are located this is only the start position, to find your accessory you MUST search by the accessory ID, after searching B2C7,  the ID list is provided below. Yes they aren't named. Match the base skill description with ITEM ID list to figure out your accessory. Eg if you have an impact ring its description is +30% penetration, from the list you see the ID for that is  6802. Easy enough to follow. 

01000AA0BB00CCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGG

AA- rank enhancement value- set to 4C( max rank which is 5)
BB - acquisition order ( don't change this)
CCCC -Accessory ID (+ Main Ability) 
D,E,F,G accessory skills 1-4 

The first accessory CCCC (6802) looks like this (impact ring with no additional skills)
0100??010068020000000000000000

?? is the accessory rank value of your item you always change whatever it is to 4C (AA)
01 is the acquisition order (BB)
6802 is the item ID (CCCC)
0000(4x) is the accessory skill which are blank for this  (D-G)

This a mystic crest accessory with 40% casting time reduction, 2x 50% chance to half AG cost and movement speed( 20% from the base accessory and 20% from the skill id)

4C- rank 5
03- acquisition order( meaning it is the 3rd accessory in my inventory, again don't touch this)
7602- item ID for mystic crest (ALL accessories come with a base skill, this has 20% cast time reduction)

SKILL IDS FOR ALL ACCESSORY  (Yes you are seeing duplicate skills from the accessory IDs list, it means that skills are stackable, for eg: mystic crest has an item id of 7602 with 20% base cast time reduction, 1900 is the skill ID for 20% cast time reduction. So if you wanted an accessory with 100% cast time reduction it would be written as 76021900190019001900 , It would be the base accessory plus the skill ID four times. Have fun with this.
