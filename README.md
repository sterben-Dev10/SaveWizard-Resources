> ### Credit is owed where value is created
> - **Incremental improvement earns shared authorship:** improve existing code → your name is added alongside prior contributors.
> - **A true rewrite earns primary authorship (with intellectual honesty):** rewrite the implementation → you may become the primary listed author, **while still crediting the original author for the research, approach, or findings that made it possible.**
